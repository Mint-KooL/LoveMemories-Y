                My dearest [Yoon],

                From the moment our paths crossed, my life has been filled with joy and wonder. Your the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and will always be the one. Every day with you is the most happiest days of my life and I cherish every moment we spend together.

                You are not just my girlfriend. You are my best friend, my confidant, and my soulmate. Your kindness, your intelligence, and your beautiful spirit inspire me to be a better person. I am so grateful for your presence in my life and for the love we share.

                It's been nearly 9 months when I'm creating the website so as we continue this journey together, I want you to know that my love for you will never change. You are the most precious gift in my life, and I promise to love, cherish, and support you forever and always.

                I always wish that you can be in my life forever and that's my biggest wish. I love you so much and you're the best Yoon!!!ü§ç

                Forever yours,
                [Mint]
